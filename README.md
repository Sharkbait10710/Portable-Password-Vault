# Portable-Password-Vault
Are online password vaults too expensive? Perhaps you wrote down your master password and can't read your own handwriting? 
Well, wouldn't it be nice if you had a portable vault that could be passed around via USB, yet require authentication in some way. 
What if you forget your master password again? Don't worry. This program will use finger-print technology to authenticate your ownership and allow you to reset your password ;).
